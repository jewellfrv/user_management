# Reflection

It was enlightening to work on this project, particularly for someone who was new to software development. It gave me a better understanding of how web applications are developed with current technologies while adhering to industry best practices. I gained knowledge about how to create a centralized codebase which made it simple to monitor modifications and maintain project organization. Working with external services, such as databases and email systems, was one of the most important things I learned. These services were administered in the project, so it was a great experience being able to connect them to the application.
